# Graphic-Designer-Website
This website was built with a graphic designer focus. This is a live website for the graphics designer to use and build his resume in. I will be using Front-end and Back end Programming to achieve the graphic designer's needs. The website is simple and is mainly to showcase his designs. This is a continues running website that will evolve when requested.


The structure of the website is to be interactive of the images to highlight the designer's work. The website will only consist of 3 pages: About, Main, and Social links.

The wesbsite will be designed as follows.
Header with logo and the header table of links

The next will be the design showcased, the images will move from right to left, When customer's mouse input goes over the image it will bend and move stopping the rotations of images.

The bottom of the page will have the contact links.

Future features will be added at request.
